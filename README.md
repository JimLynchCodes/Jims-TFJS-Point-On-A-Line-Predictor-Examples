# Jims-TFJS-Point-On-A-Line-Predictor-Examples
Some tensorflow.js examples of models that predict points of lines...

## How To Use These Examples
Each folder in this root diretory is a different project with its own package.json, source files, etc.

Navigate into each project directory, and install the libraries: 

```
npm i
```

Each project will have a "model training script" that can be run as:
```
npm start
```

Then with the trained model you can run the predictor script like this:
```
npm test
```
